Revision history for Test-Refcount

0.07    CHANGES:
         * Use pureperl core B module rather than Devel::Refcount, for
           avoiding XS in the deptree of a Test module

0.06    CHANGES:
         * Optionally use Devel::FindRef but don't depend on it being

           it fail.

0.05    CHANGES:
         * Added 'use warnings'
         * Various small updates to keep CPANTS happy

         * Skip regexp count tests on perl 5.11 because of ongoing issue with
           refcounts there.

0.03    BUGFIXES:
         * Updated regexps in test code to account for change in
           Devel::FindRef's output format at version 1.4
           (fixes http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=41487)

0.02    CHANGES:
         * Use Devel::FindRef to print a trace of references if the assert

           of broken code.
